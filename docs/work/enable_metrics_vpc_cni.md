title: Enabling metrics for VPC CNI

## Background

Looking into why theÂ `cni-metrics-helper`Â chart was having issues pulling metrics from the cni pods:  

```
metrics/metrics.go:399","msg":"grabMetricsFromTarget: Failed to grab CNI endpoint: the server is currently unable to handle the request (get pods aws-node-2jfgx:61678)"}
```

Looks like the metrics helper is hardcoded to extract metrics from portÂ `61678`Â whereas the cni pods expose their metrics atÂ `61680` ðŸ« 
```
aws-eks-nodeagent {"level":"info","ts":"2024-10-28T21:00:25.036Z","caller":"metrics/metrics.go:23","msg":"Serving metrics on ","port":61680}
```
