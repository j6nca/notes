# Kitchen Items

- Baking rack
- 
# Preparation

- Marinate chicken thighs (overnight or even just an hour before cooking time is fine)
- Pre-heat oven to 425F
- Pat chicken thighs down with paper towel
- Add rub of your choice to both sides of thighs
- Bake for 30-35 minutes or when internal temp is 165F
- During this time you can prep sides, or make some bbq sauce
	- Can mix together ketchup, worcestershire sauce, mustard, smoked paprika and adjust to your liking - we don't need too much of this, unless you like it saucy
- Take out and brush both sides with bbq sauce, return to the oven for another  5-10 minutes
