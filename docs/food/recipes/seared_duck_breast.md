I ended up making this for valentine's dinner. The presentation could've be better, it was my first time breaking down a whole bird (or cooking with duck in general) and it barely thawed in time but we had it with a side of mash, [[roasted_vegetables|roasted carrots]] and a red wine reduction glaze.

Don't worry, I used the rest of the duck later in the week to make other dishes and stock (recipes coming soon).
