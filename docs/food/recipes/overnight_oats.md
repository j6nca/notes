# Notes

- I started incorporating oats into my day-to-day diet as it is a good source of fiber, relatively flexible and keeps me satiated
- I do 200g of liquid as I prefer softer oats (it all gets absorbed) a 50:50 ratio of `Lactantia chocolate milk` to get some extra protein along with water.
- For sweetener if you're being wary of macros, I'd suggest using low/zero cal sweetener I've had great success with `Steeves Zero Sugar Maple Syrup` which is also relatively cheap!
- Bananas work as great fruit option to throw in here, even if super ripe (as long as you don't mind the texture)
