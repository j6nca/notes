This is my go-to recipe for a flavour and nutrient packed carb to go alongside various other proteins like a nice [[steak]] (sort of like an ad-hoc burrito bowl). All portions can be adjusted according to your preferences.

Add some more veggies and tomato sauce and you can probably turn this into a simple vegan chilli-style dish.
