# Ingredients

- 1kg Chicken breast (feel free to substitute with other proteins for preference, just adjust macros accordingly)
- 2/3 cup bone broth (more protein)
- 500g Cottage cheese
- 100g Sun-dried tomatoes
- 50g Parmesan
- 500g Pasta of choice, I like shells or rigatoni for this
- 200g Spinach
- 1 tbsp Smoked paprika
- 3 tbsp Garlic powder (as much as you like, really)
- 1 tbsp Italian seasonings

# Kitchen Items

- Blender
- Large pot
- Pan
- Meal prep containers (Optional)

# Preparation

- Start a pot of boiling water for your pasta
- While waiting for water to boil, dice chicken breast into 1-inch cubes
- Season chicken breast with salt & pepper, Italian seasoning
- Blend cottage cheese, parmesan, sun-dried tomatoes, and remaining spices together, resulting should be light-orange in colour, set aside for later
- Once water is boiling, throw pasta into pot, cook for package time minus ~2 mins (we will finish off the cooking in low heat when we mix it all together)
- At the same time, in a pan, throw the chicken in and cook on med-high heat for  ~8min to develop a sear and cook most of the way through (again, we will finish this off all together)
- Above two steps should take roughly the same time, once pasta is ready, strain it out first to prevent further cooking for the time being
- Turn heat to low and in the bigger vessel, place everything together (including the sauce). Be sure to do this at low heat to avoid splitting the sauce
- Mix together and add spinach.  Cook for 5 min
- Serve and/or portion out for meal prep!

# Notes

This recipe is extremely flexible, honestly the first time I made it i was missing most of the seasoning powders and it still tasted delicious. Definitely a staple in the high-protein meal prep rotation.

If you really want to save on dishes, you can even do this all in one big pan, which aligns with the theme of "Marry me chicken" as you'll be able to use the chicken fond, trade-off being time, of course.
