A fantastic Italian restaurant. Be warned, there are often long wait times and they do not take reservations. We went on a Saturday afternoon and ended up waiting approx 45 minutes. But it was well worth the wait, pasta was delicious, we got an order of meatballs, the classic rigatoni with rosé and a truffle mushroom lasagna and each dish was fantastic. It was so satisfying indulging inv the rigatoni after seeing it look so good on TikTok. The truffle lasagna was RICH.
