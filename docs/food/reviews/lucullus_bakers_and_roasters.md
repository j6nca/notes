If you ever want a Hong Kong cafe with immaculate vibes go here. We took a walk to Lucullus in Downtown Markham and were pleasantly surprised. The decor feels straight out of a cafe in Europe. Unfortunately they didn't have ice this day and we weren't about to order hot coffee on a day like this, so we got drinks elsewhere. We also got a deep fired curry beef bun, a char siu bun and a chicken pot pastry. All three were very tasty, my favourite probably being the chicken pot pastry, which was similar to a mini chicken pot pie, but in a flakey pastry. The buns are a little pricier than your run-of-the-mill HK bakery but just by a margin. Overall I would definitely have to recommend this place and look forward to coming back to try the coffee + take more photos.
