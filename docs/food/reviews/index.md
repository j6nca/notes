# Reviews

This is a collection of food reviews from places I've visited. All opinions are subjective and my own. I've based these decisions based on the following factors:

- food
- service
- atmosphere
- value

## Map

I enjoy measuring and recording my own data day-to-day, here is a map of all tracking all those places:
