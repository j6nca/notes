# Kelseys

📌: [3131 Hwy 7, Markham, ON L3R 0J5](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7pjGNEsDf5QxVSMw7)
💸: \$\$

## Rating: ★★★☆☆

Food is pretty good, I was a big fan of my roast chicken breast, however, my partners chicken alfredo was lacking and didn't really taste like a chicken alfredo. The dessert brownie was great.
