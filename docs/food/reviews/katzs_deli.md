## Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

My first stop in NYC, went to meet up with Cece and we headed over to Katz's for lunch, seeking their pastrami #sandwiches. During peak hours, its packed with high energy, everyone waiting in queues to get their orders. The pastrami cutters were very friendly and offer you a sample cut of the pastrami. The sandwich was delicious, the pastrami was the perfect ratio of fatty and moist for a sandwich, between two pieces of soft rye bread. The order also came with a selection of half-sour and full-sour pickles, which gave a refreshing acidic snap. Having had a [[schwartz_deli|similar sandwich in Montreal]], I much prefer this sandwich. Make sure to keep your ticket to pay when you leave!

We actually came back a few days later as we were trying to get a Lox bagel from Russ & Daughters, which was closed on Mondays and this place was just down the street.
