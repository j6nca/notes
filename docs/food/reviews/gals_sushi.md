## Review: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

One of my go-to places for a good-value, #sushi lunch set. There are a variety of lunch specials to choose from, with a wide selection of Japanese and Korean components. I usually get takeout from here but I've had equally good experiences dining in.

The sushi is fresh, and there is a great selection. The different lunch sets let you choose what you want to eat. If you don't like sashimi, you can get a set that has more rolls, or you can straight up modify the order to sub all sashimi for salmon, or all handrolls for crab rolls (*note that this will add $1-2 to your order*). Their crab salad rolls are so good and always something I look forward to with this lunch set.
