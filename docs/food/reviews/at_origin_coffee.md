## Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê

Vibes in this store are immaculate, super cozy and honestly exactly what I would picture when thinking of a cafe. The place was just down the street from [[piano_piano|Piano Piano]]. Unfortunately, I couldn't say the same about the coffee. I'm not sure if it was just an off-day but my drink (americano), and my partner's drink (oat latte) just didn't taste right. They were very watered down. The caramel chocolate chip cookie was fine though.
