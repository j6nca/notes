## Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Planta Cocina was an excellent (albeit expensive) first venture into upscale vegan dining. The menu had creative vegan takes on Mexican cuisine, and I found my self enjoying every bite of what I ate, with the taco platter each taco had a unique profile. My standouts were the jackfruit, cauliflower and potato tacos. It was truly an eye-opener and made the idea of going potentially going meat-less one day very approachable. The service was amazing, near the end the waiter asked us if we wanted a top up of chips and guac free of charge (naturally we took the offer), **sooo** good. 

Unfortunately this location, as well as one of their offshoot restaurants Planta Burger which I wanted to try, closed down permanently in 2023. This leaves Toronto with the remaining [[planta_queen|Planta Queen]] which in my opinion doesn't hold a flame to Planta Cocina, but I'll leave that for a review later on.
