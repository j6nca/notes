title: Recommendations
---


I was inspired to start this section as a friend of mine recently was in the market for a new full-size keyboard and it got me in a rabbit hole of comparing lots of different options and seeing which ones I would pick and choose to recommend to them. I'll be looking at features, price, value to try and cater a list of solid recommendations for different use cases.

## General preferences

These are some of the criteria I take into consideration when purchasing my own keyboards, you may see some of my recommendations bias towards features mentioned in this list.

- Support for open-source software configuration. This is a huge one for me, I personally don't like installing a bunch of third-party software as it poses usability, maintainability and security concerns to me. I generally only seek out keyboards that have QMK/VIA these days, with the exception of hall-effect keyboards ([Wootility](https://wootility.io/) has been great so far).
- Gasket mounted. This is more of a preference, I enjoy the way gasket mounted keyboards sound over traditional plate mounted.
- I am a fan of smaller form factor keyboards (4X-7X% keyboards) in general, they take up less desk space and more room to move your mouse (i.e for FPS games).

## Layouts

- [[4X|4X% keyboards]]
- [[6X|6X% keyboards]]
- [[7X|7X% keyboards]]
- [[8X|7X% keyboards]]
- [[9X|9X% keyboards]]
