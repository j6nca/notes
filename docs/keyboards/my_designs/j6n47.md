# j6n47

## Background

This document will outline the process I went through in building my very own hand-wired keyboard from scratch.

## Goals

- Smaller form-factor (<60%)
- Hotswap
- OLED Screen?
- QMK/VIA support
- Ortholinear

## Parts & Cost

| Part                   | Cost (CAD) |

| RPi Pico               | 12.95      |
| Copper Wiring          | 11.99      |
| Diodes                 | 14.68      |
| Soldering Kit          | 19.99      |
| Switches (KTT Kang V3) | 25.87      |
| Kaihl Hotswap Sockets  | 17.29      |
| Keycaps                |            |
| 3D Printing            |            |
| Total Cost (WIP)       | 56.11      |

## Layout

I initially found [keyboard-layout-editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/), where I viewed existing layouts and played around with creating my own layouts. For this project, my goal was to create a smaller form factor keyboard than my current 60%.

## Working with QMK

### Setup

Setup of qmk was fairly straight-forward, following the available [documentation](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_getting_started).
```
pip3 install --user qmk
echo 'PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> $HOME/.zshrc && source $HOME/.zshrc
qmk setup
qmk compile -kb clueboard/66/rev3 -km default
```

### QMK Configuration

I realized I would not be able to reuse the raw data I created earlier in `keyboard-layout-editor`, so I looked to port over my layout to qmk configuration.

I forked the `qmk_firmware` repo to include my new layout & created a keyboard profile for myself, adding respective pins based on the rpi pico's pinout diagram.

```
qmk new-keyboard
...
qmk compile -kb handwired/j6n47 -km default
```
The changes I made can be viewed [here](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/compare/master...j6nca:qmk_firmware:j6n47).

## Worklog

**Update: 2023/06/28**
Designed the layout for the keyboard using [keyboard-layout-editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/).

I then tried a few different options to take this layout and generate a 3D-printable `.stl` file:

- [keebio's plate generator](https://plate.keeb.io/)
- [ai03's plate generator](https://kbplate.ai03.com/)
- [skillkb's plate generator](http://builder.swillkb.com/)

I ended up using keebio's plate generator, though it seems the three options have quite similar feature sets.

**Update: 2023/06/30**
Went to the library to print the pcb plate! Had to tinker with the fill (make it much less dense than before) to get the print to fit the timeslot I had booked (we are only allotted max 2 hrs for a print). [View a short clip of the print here](https://youtu.be/e6MvvLDK9dA)

Additionally did a test fitting with some spare switches I had lying around.

After flashing the 
I wanted the keyboard to also support VIA configuration (that way I won't need to reflash the mcu everytime I want to make changes), enabling support for VIA was surprisingly simple following a [guide from youtuber Joe Scotto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7d5yzBOup9U).

**Update: 2023/07/07**
Completed the soldering for the keyboard matrix and microcontroller
