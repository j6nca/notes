# Keyboards

Here I discuss keyboards, including boards that I've purchased as well as boards I have designed from scratch. I also try to provide some buying [[keyboards/recommendations/index|recommendations]] for those in the market for a new keyboard.

## Typing

If you're looking for typing tests, my go-to and favourite site to cure boredom is [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/profile/j6n). You can essentially customize your typing tests down to every detail including using custom layouts to reflect your keyboard.

## Custom builds

These are keyboards that I've built or purchased.

### Wooting 60HE

This is likely going to be my endgame keyboard for the foresee-able. Hall-effect seems to be the bleeding edge of this input technology and until there is further innovation I don't think I will stray too far from this board (I may occasionally still build boards for the fun of it). Here's hoping that opensource keyboard software supports hall-effect switches soon ðŸ˜Š. List of mods (heavily inspired by [Optimum's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuULrGtbDy4)):

- Tofu60 Redux case
- Blank side-print shine-through keycaps (looks blank but has the option to light up just in case).
- Hand-lubed stock magnetic switches

### Epomaker TH40

This is the first 40% keyboard that I have purchased. It's a solid budget keyboard for those looking for a small form factor. Comes with a slightly thinner Wooting-style strap as well for the portable typists. With its gasket mounting and stock Wisteria linear switches, it sounds like a dream. The board also comes with VIA support making configuration a breeze to do on any machine.

After about a week of usage I can say this is a great 40% keyboard, but I haven't been able to commit fully to the layout. The reduced number of keys is isn't too bad thanks to the magic of layering, however the shift in placement of the `/?` and `fn` keys have made it less enjoyable for me. I'm sure with some remapping or more practice, one could really get attuned with this little beast.

### Iris Rev. 8

An split ortho-linear keyboard.

### Keebio Quefrency Rev. 5

I found myself recently spending less time in games and more time with work, projects, surfing the web and just doing day-to-day activities. I've been eyeing the split + staggered layout for a long time and decided to finally bite the bullet. This kit comes from [Keebio](https://keeb.io/), whom I've purchased from before (See the Iris Rev. 8). The criteria I had in mind when looking to purchase this keyboard was:

- familiar layout: The golden range being 60-65% as it has the perfect middle ground of smaller footprint while enough keys that I'm  not going mad with layers. Preferring a 65% as then I can get dedicated arrow keys (really handy for overall navigation sometimes)
- split keyboard: gives me the flexibility to move my hands around instead of forcing them into a single position when typing
- staggered layout: this is crucial to me, not necessarily due to preference, but because laptop/default keyboards nowadays are all staggered layout and I would prefer to not have to constantly switch between multiple layouts if possible
- QMK/VIA support: this is always a plus to me, no reliance on random one-off third party software

Overall, I am really pleased with how this keyboard turned out. It is a bit on the pricey side but it ticks all the bells and whistles that I needed for an everyday board. One thing I wished there was an aluminum case for this board, I reached out to Keebio who said they had drafted out a case but never ended up going forward with manufacturing. Though the community behind it is vast, which makes me hopeful someone will some day make an aluminum case for it.

## Designs

These are keyboards I've designed from the ground up. With new innovations in the hall-effect switch space, I am eager to work on new designs with these switches. Just waiting for someone to open source software for configuring these keyboards. ðŸ‘€
