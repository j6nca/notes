# Background

# Requirements

Unfortunately initially using Grafana Oncall in many ways has been spoiling us as  it is quite a feature-rich product. In my evaluations I'll take into account what features we heavily relied on, and what features were nice-to-haves.

- Scheduling
- Slack integration
- AlertManager integration
- 

# Options
