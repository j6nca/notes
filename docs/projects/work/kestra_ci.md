# Background

Small addition here to the kestra demo, we've added CI to sync kestra flows and allow us to centrally manage those flows in a repo. 

This enables us to better manage and review changes, and using the namespace folder structure inherited from kestra, we can assign codeowners to respective teams working on flows

Disclaimer: This will need a minor refactor if we choose to go ahead with FOSS and have separate kestra clusters for teams.
