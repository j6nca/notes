# Background

I've always liked the idea of keeping notes organized and together (whether that was truly the case is a different story). I found out about Obsidian sometime in 2022, and started moving all my notes and knowledge collection into a vault. I liked the idea of creating links between notes  and the graphical visualization to really illustrate how bits of knowledge are tied together. On the other hand, I've also wanted to create a way to share my own thoughts and opinions with friends and others on the web. That led me to hosting a public vault containing my own personal notes and projects to share.

## Requirements

I needed something that could:
- Easily integrate with my notes
	- Ideally my notes can be kept separate, and all I need to d
- Ideally bring some functionality from Obsidian itself
	- Namely the visualizations and tagging, I liked how the graph drew links between relevant notes

## Rev. 1

I initially started with a barebones mkdocs setup, a popular static site generator for documentation. I eventually added some Obsidian-esque plugins to make the experience browsing the site as similar.

## Rev. 2

I eventually came across Quartz which does some of the visualizations out of the box. I was also a fan of its design and decided to switch SSGs.
