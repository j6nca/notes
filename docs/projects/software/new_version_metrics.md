# New version metrics

Something that comes up fairly often at work is that it would be nice to view software versions in a dashboard. Building on that, it would be nice to view what is up-to-date, and what needs to be updated.

## Features

- ignore/allow-listing release tags
- check frequency
- metrics endpoint (so we can use this info in our visualizations)
  - guides for creating visualizations with metrics in grafana
- user-defined software list (focus primarily on github for now)
- helm chart support
- chat integration support (i.e: slack)
