# Background

The premise for this project was simple. I was inspired by a few kubernetes workload visualizers (namely, kube-ops-view and flyingtoast) and wanted to try my hand at creating my own with a few small goals in mind. The source and further installation details can be viewed [here](https://github.com/j6nca/kube-cats).

- [x] Display running kubernetes workloads in a fun manner
- [ ] Leverage relevant workload information to allow adding custom additions based on state of sprite
- [x] Pseudo randomized asset usage
- [x] Run on k8s
- [ ] Easy to setup (helm chart?)
