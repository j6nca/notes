# My first ITX build

I recently decided to go for a minimal build, and try to de-clutter and better organize my workspace. With my limited PC building experience, I decided it was time to invest in a small form factor (sff) build, which I plan to use and upgrade in the long-term.

## Upgrade history

I will document any upgrades to the system over time here.

- 24/07/08: Decided to switch to an air-cooled set up with the NR200 as I liked the look/flexibility of the case more.
