## Overview

This was my first trip to Japan, something myself and my roommate Clement were looking forward to towards the end of the school term. We travelled with my parents, though most of the day we would split up and go our separate ways, reuniting for meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner). Though it was the end of the summer and the heat was at its peak (typhoon season too I believe), it was an absolute blast and I can't wait to go again!
