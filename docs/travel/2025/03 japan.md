# Overview

For this trip we decided to try out a tool called [wanderlog](https://wanderlog.com/) to help build out our itinerary. Its quite a helpful tool as it combines mapping and organizing POI with useful location information and recommendations.

## JR Pass

With the changes to JR Pass in 2023, buying the full JR Pass is no longer the best option for  budget when travelling within Japan. Luckily there are new passes introduced that still meet our use-case (roughly the golden path). During our time in Japan this year, we will be visiting Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto and the Hokuriku Arch Pass covers all these stops.

```markdown
| Pass               | Price (JPY) |
|--------------------|-------------|
| JR Pass            | 50000       |
| Hokuriku Arch Pass | 24500       |
```
