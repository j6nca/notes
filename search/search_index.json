The sandwich was delicious, the pastrami was the perfect ratio of fatty and moist for a sandwich, between two pieces of soft rye bread. The order also came with a selection of half-sour and full-sour pickles, which gave a refreshing acidic snap. Having had a similar sandwich in Montreal, I much prefer this sandwich.

We also got a deep fired curry beef bun, a char siu bun and a chicken pot pastry. All three were very tasty, my favourite probably being the chicken pot pastry, which was similar to a mini chicken pot pie, but in a flakey pastry. The buns are a little pricier than your run-of-the-mill HK bakery but just by a margin.
